# Crawl4AI v0.6.0 Release Notes

We're excited to announce the release of **Crawl4AI v0.6.0**, our biggest and most feature-rich update yet. This version introduces major architectural upgrades, brand-new capabilities for geo-aware crawling, high-efficiency scraping, and real-time streaming support for scalable deployments.

---

## Highlights

### 1. **World-Aware Crawlers**
Crawl as if youâ€™re anywhere in the world. With v0.6.0, each crawl can simulate:
- Specific GPS coordinates
- Browser locale
- Timezone

Example:
```python
CrawlerRunConfig(
    url="https://browserleaks.com/geo",
    locale="en-US",
    timezone_id="America/Los_Angeles",
    geolocation=GeolocationConfig(
        latitude=34.0522,
        longitude=-118.2437,
        accuracy=10.0
    )
)
```
Great for accessing region-specific content or testing global behavior.

---

### 2. **Native Table Extraction**
Extract HTML tables directly into usable formats like Pandas DataFrames or CSV with zero parsing hassle. All table data is available under `result.media["tables"]`.

Example:
```python
raw_df = pd.DataFrame(
    result.media["tables"][0]["rows"],
    columns=result.media["tables"][0]["headers"]
)
```
This makes it ideal for scraping financial data, pricing pages, or anything tabular.

---

### 3. **Browser Pooling & Pre-Warming**
We've overhauled browser management. Now, multiple browser instances can be pooled and pages pre-warmed for ultra-fast launches:
- Reduces cold-start latency
- Lowers memory spikes
- Enhances parallel crawling stability

This powers the new **Docker Playground** experience and streamlines heavy-load crawling.

---

### 4. **Traffic & Snapshot Capture**
Need full visibility? You can now capture:
- Full network traffic logs
- Console output
- MHTML page snapshots for post-crawl audits and debugging

No more guesswork on what happened during your crawl.

---

### 5. **MCP API and Streaming Support**
Weâ€™re exposing **MCP socket and SSE endpoints**, allowing:
- Live streaming of crawl results
- Real-time integration with agents or frontends
- A new Playground UI for interactive crawling

This is a major step towards making Crawl4AI real-time ready.

---

### 6. **Stress-Test Framework**
Want to test performance under heavy load? v0.6.0 includes a new memory stress-test suite that supports 1,000+ URL workloads. Ideal for:
- Load testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Validating memory efficiency

---

## Core Improvements
- Robots.txt compliance
- Proxy rotation support
- Improved URL normalization and session reuse
- Shared data across crawler hooks
- New page routing logic

---

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations
- Legacy `crawl4ai/browser/*` modules are removed. Update imports accordingly.
- `AsyncPlaywrightCrawlerStrategy.get_page` now uses a new function signature.
- Deprecated markdown generator aliases now point to `DefaultMarkdownGenerator` with warning.

---

## Miscellaneous Updates
- FastAPI validators replaced custom validation logic
- Docker build now based on a Chromium layer
- Repo-wide cleanup: ~36,000 insertions, ~5,000 deletions

---

## New Examples Included
- Geo-location crawling
- Network + console log capture
- Docker MCP API usage
- Markdown selector usage
- Crypto project data extraction
